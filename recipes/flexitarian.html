   <h1>Rethink What a Meal Can Be</h1>
   <p>If you grew up with plates divided into three equal portions – grains, veggies, and a portion of meat – a flexitarian plate can seem, well, lacking. So instead of filling the "meat" section up with meat substitutes, think outside the box! Instead of dividing your plate into pieces, consider recipes like stews, soups, and chilis that can be complete meals in and of themselves.</p>
   <p>To see what we mean, take inspiration from abroad. From the vegetable curries of Thailand to the dals of India, from the falafel of Israel to the mezze of Greece, recipes from abroad can help jump-start your flexitarian way of life – and invite you to travel around the world from the comfort of your own kitchen.</p>
